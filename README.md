This repo is meant to be a bunch of docs for a serie of pentesting boxes, thoses are my first ones, and they are meant to be very beginner friendly, with a difficulty gradually upscaled.
Thoses boxes are made by @nostalgy and should be added [creed.ctf](https://creed-ctf.fr/) sooner or later. I want to thank him for his work, this is a very good balancing of difficulty for a beginner.
I'm a french guy and I do this doc to train my english too, so sorry in advance if I make somes mistakes and enjoy my discovery of pentesting !
